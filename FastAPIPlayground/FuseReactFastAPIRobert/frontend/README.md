# CRISP Demo: Frontend

This is the frontend part of the CRISP Demo app. Built with Fuse-react and other JavaScript libaries. 
For more detailed documentation on Fuse-react, see [here](http://react-material.fusetheme.com/documentation/getting-started/introduction)!

## Set up

First, follow the instructions [this documentation](http://react-material.fusetheme.com/documentation/getting-started/installation) to install Fuse-react in your machine. THe installation may take up to 7-8 minutes because React projects often have lots of dependencies. ðŸ˜‚

Most important code live in the highlighted `main` directory. And the final project strucure should look like this:
